### 8.1 Bitcoin

**Bitcoin (BTC):**  
A decentralized digital currency invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. It enables peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries, secured by cryptography and recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain.

**Satoshi Nakamoto:**  
The pseudonymous creator(s) of Bitcoin. Their identity remains unknown as of today.

**Blockchain:**  
An append-only, cryptographically secured digital ledger composed of blocks. Each block contains a list of transactions and is linked to the previous block using a hash.

**Block:**  
A container for a batch of Bitcoin transactions, including a reference to the previous block and a nonce used in proof of work.

**Genesis Block:**  
The first block in the Bitcoin blockchain, mined by Satoshi Nakamoto in January 2009.

**Mining:**  
The process of creating new blocks by solving complex computational puzzles, verifying transactions, and securing the network.

**Hashrate:**  
The total computational power used by the Bitcoin network to mine and process transactions.

**Nonce:**  
A number used once in mining, adjusted by miners to find a hash below a certain target difficulty.

**Difficulty Adjustment:**  
Occurs approximately every 2,016 blocks (~2 weeks) to ensure blocks are mined roughly every 10 minutes. It adjusts mining difficulty according to network hashrate.

**Halving:**  
An event every 210,000 blocks (~4 years) that cuts the block reward in half, slowing the rate of Bitcoin issuance.

**Total Supply:**  
Capped at 21 million bitcoins, which ensures scarcity and disinflation over time.

**Private Key:**  
A secret 256-bit number used to sign transactions. Whoever holds the private key controls the associated bitcoins.

**Public Key:**  
Generated from the private key, it is used to derive a Bitcoin address and validate digital signatures.

**Bitcoin Address:**  
A hashed version of the public key used to receive payments. Formats include Legacy (P2PKH), Script (P2SH), and SegWit (Bech32).

**Wallet:**  
Software or hardware that stores private keys. Types include mobile, desktop, hardware, paper, and web wallets.

**Seed Phrase (Mnemonic Phrase):**  
A human-readable backup of a wallet, typically 12 or 24 words. Used to recover private keys.

**Transaction (TX):**  
A digital message signed with a private key that instructs the Bitcoin network to transfer funds.

**TXID (Transaction ID):**  
A unique identifier for a Bitcoin transaction, usually the hash of the transaction data.

**Fee (Mining Fee):**  
An amount paid to miners to prioritize a transaction. Fees are based on size in bytes, not value transferred.

**SegWit (Segregated Witness):**  
An upgrade that separates signature data from transaction data, reducing transaction size and improving scalability.

**Taproot:**  
A major upgrade improving privacy, efficiency, and smart contract functionality by enabling Schnorr signatures and MAST (Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees).

**Bech32:**  
A SegWit-compatible address format starting with ‚Äúbc1‚Äù that improves error-detection and efficiency.

**Multisignature (Multisig):**  
A setup requiring multiple private keys to authorize a Bitcoin transaction (e.g., 2-of-3 multisig).

**Time Lock / Timelock:**  
A script that restricts when a transaction can be spent. Used in smart contracts and the Lightning Network.

**Orphan Block:**  
A valid block that is not included in the main chain due to another block being accepted at the same height.

**Dust:**  
An amount of Bitcoin too small to spend because the fee would exceed the value transferred.

**Coinbase Transaction:**  
The first transaction in a block, created by the miner, which includes the block reward.

**Change Address:**  
An address used to return leftover Bitcoin back to the sender after a transaction, similar to change in a cash transaction.

**RBF (Replace-by-Fee):**  
Allows a transaction to be rebroadcast with a higher fee to speed up confirmation.

**CPFP (Child Pays for Parent):**  
A fee-bumping method where a new transaction (child) incentivizes miners to confirm a low-fee unconfirmed parent transaction.

**Full Node:**  
A node that fully validates all Bitcoin transactions and blocks. Helps enforce network consensus rules.

**Pruned Node:**  
A full node that discards old block data after validation to save space.

**SPV (Simplified Payment Verification):**  
A lightweight method of verifying transactions without downloading the entire blockchain, used by mobile wallets.

**Cold Storage:**  
Keeping private keys offline to protect against hacking, typically using hardware wallets or paper wallets.

### 8.2 Lightning Network

**Lightning Network (LN):**  
A layer-2 scaling solution built on top of Bitcoin that enables fast, low-cost, off-chain transactions through bidirectional payment channels.

**Payment Channel:**  
A temporary, off-chain agreement between two parties that allows for multiple transactions. Only the opening and closing transactions are recorded on-chain.

**Commitment Transaction:**  
A transaction representing the current state of a Lightning channel. Each update creates a new commitment transaction signed by both parties.

**Revocation Key:**  
A mechanism that allows a party to invalidate a prior channel state, used to punish fraud attempts.

**HTLC (Hashed Timelock Contract):**  
Used for routing payments across the Lightning Network securely by combining hashlocks and timelocks.

**Routing Node:**  
A Lightning node that relays payments between other nodes for a small fee.

**Hop:**  
Each intermediary node through which a Lightning payment passes before reaching the recipient.

**Channel Reserve:**  
The minimum amount of satoshis a user must maintain in a channel, preventing it from being closed in an uncooperative way.

**Dust Limit:**  
The minimum amount of satoshis that can be included in a channel update to avoid creating uneconomical outputs.

**Invoice:**  
A BOLT11-encoded string that specifies an amount, expiration time, routing hints, and payment hash.

**Preimage:**  
A secret value used to unlock an HTLC payment. Revealing the preimage proves payment completion.

**Onion Routing:**  
A privacy technique used in Lightning to obscure the full path of a payment by encrypting each hop‚Äôs instructions.

**Sphinx Protocol:**  
The cryptographic protocol enabling onion routing in Lightning.

**Anchor Outputs:**  
A mechanism allowing channel participants to attach transaction fees later, making fee estimation more flexible.

**Taproot Channels:**  
Future Lightning channels using Taproot‚Äôs improved privacy and efficiency features.

**Dual-Funded Channels:**  
Lightning channels where both participants contribute funds during the opening phase, enhancing liquidity on both sides.

**Splicing:**  
A proposed feature allowing users to add or remove funds from a channel without closing it.

**Watchtower:**  
A service that monitors the blockchain on behalf of offline Lightning nodes to detect and penalize fraud attempts.

**Static Channel Backup (SCB):**  
A file that allows recovery of Lightning funds if a node or wallet is lost. It stores information about channel partners and balances.

**Fee Policy:**  
A routing node‚Äôs strategy for charging base and proportional fees for relaying payments.

**Base Fee:**  
A fixed satoshi fee charged per payment regardless of amount.

**Fee Rate (Proportional Fee):**  
A percentage fee charged based on the amount forwarded (e.g., 0.01%).

**Liquidity Management:**  
The practice of balancing inbound and outbound capacity in channels to maintain routing capability.

**Loop (Lightning Loop):**  
A service that allows non-custodial swaps between Lightning and on-chain Bitcoin to manage liquidity.

**Amboss / 1ML / Terminal Web:**  
Popular online tools for visualizing Lightning Network topology and node statistics.

**LSP (Lightning Service Provider):**  
A service offering liquidity, channel management, or infrastructure support to users or merchants on the Lightning Network.

**BOLT (Basis of Lightning Technology):**  
A standardized set of specifications for Lightning implementations to ensure interoperability.

**Zero-Conf Channels:**  
Channels used immediately after funding without waiting for on-chain confirmations‚Äîriskier but faster for some use cases.

**Wumbo Channel:**  
A channel larger than the default 0.167 BTC limit, used by advanced users or large-scale services.
